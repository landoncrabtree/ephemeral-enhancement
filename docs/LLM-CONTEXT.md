# Context

This document serves as a cumulative source-of-truth for different easter eggs (specifically, ciphers) found in Call of Duty: Black Ops III Zombies. The goal of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive list of all ciphers found in the game, along with their solutions. This can allow for large-language models (LLMs) to gain a better contextual understanding of the game's easter eggs, and potentially generate solutions to unsolved ciphers.

## Websites Used to Encipher

### Used for multiple ciphers

- PracticalCryptography - <http://practicalcryptography.com/>
- Rumkin - https://rumkin.com/ (Note: some ciphers have been changed since 2017, you might need to use Internet Archive to replicate solves.)
- Cryptool Online - <http://cryptool-online.org/> (Note: website has changed massively since launch, you need to use Internet Archive to find old, relevant tools.)
- Cryptii V2 - <https://v2.cryptii.com/>

### Used once off

- Braingle - <http://www.braingle.com/>
- CIMT - <https://www.cimt.org.uk/>
- PMacg - <https://pmacg.io/>
- Woodmann - <http://www.woodmann.com/> (Note: site is gone, internet archive needed)

## Limitations

- We do not expect modern cryptography to be used to encipher/encrypt plaintext (e.g. AES, RSA, etc.). We expect all ciphers to be created from classical cryptography techniques or a custom cipher.
